# I said we _do not_ talk about that here..
Except that we do, _***like now.***_
## What does the name stand for?
The _ACTUAL_ name that had to be used was "EPCI - Easy Python Calculator (not Impressive)"
Why is it "not impressive"?, because it <s>isn't</s> **wasn't**.
<br><br>
Then when i was creating the repo and finishing the code, i just said something like: _"Since it **IS** a _template_, let's call it _Easiest Py(thon) Calculator **Template**_"
## And so, why didn't i just change the _actual_ name? (the acronym)
Because i liked how _**EPCI**_ sounded.

(tbh EPCT sounds decent too but i already used EPCI in the bit.ly custom link to the repo and i cannot change it so..)
