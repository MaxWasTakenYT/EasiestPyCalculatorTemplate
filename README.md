### EPCI is (as the name suggests) the Easiest Python Calculator Template (or at least i tried making it "the EASIEST")
### Don't ask why the name is EPCI instead of EPCT, [we don't talk about that around here..][https://wallpapers.com/images/featured/scary-pictures-xohd65s2k77uj11h.jpg]
###### ! Abuses comments for explanation's sake !
###### ! Uses the 'time' and 'tkinter/tkinter_messagebox' modules, 100% made in python !
###### ! If you want to fork this on replit, you can find it in the templates page, or in [my profile.](https://bit.ly/mx_info) !
