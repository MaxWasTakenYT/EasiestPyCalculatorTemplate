# The EPCI Template
![Status Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Finished-30BB30)
### EPCI is (as the name suggests) the Easiest Python Calculator Template (or at least i tried making it "the EASIEST")
###### ! Abuses comments for explanation's sake !
###### ! Uses the 'time' and 'tkinter/tkinter_messagebox' modules, 100% made in python !
###### ! If you want to fork this on replit, you can find it in the templates page, or in [my profile.](https://bit.ly/mx_info) !
